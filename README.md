# How to use

* expand an instance of the prefab you want to replace (at least one object of the original has to exist).
* select all the objects you want to replace the original prefab with.
* you dont need to select any of the objects of original prefab, if you dont want then you need to delete them first.
* make sure the last object you select any object of the prefab you want to replace.
* the "replace prefab with selection" button should show up in the object panel.

### notes:

 may take a while depending in how many objects are in the level.

 maybe make a backup of the level before using this just in case.

 sometimes some objects go invisible, you need to reopen the level for them to show up. thats why you should backup.
