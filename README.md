# Installation

* Download the [BepInEx 6.0.0 il2cpp bleeding Edge build.](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)
* Follow the BepInEx installation guide available on their [Github](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx).
* Extract the Mod .dll file in the generated BepInNex->Plugins folder.


# How to use

* expand an instance of the prefab you want to replace/update.
* select any object of the prefab instance.
* group select all the objects you want to replace/update the original prefab with.
* the objects of the original prefab will be kept even if you dont select them. delete any unwanted objects (keep at least one so you can select it to be replaced!)
* the "replace 'PrefabName' with selection" button should show up in the object panel.

### notes:

 may take a while depending in how many objects are in the level.

 sometimes some objects go invisible, you need to save and reopen the level for them to show up. maybe backup the level before doing this.
